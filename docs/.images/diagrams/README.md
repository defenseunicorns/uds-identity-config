# UDS Identity Config Diagrams

## Making Changes to Diagrams for UDS Core

Utilize the drawio file to make changes across all diagrams. Make sure that changes are exported in the svg format and put into this directory if being used in the docs as well as any changes to the drawio file.

## How to Customize For Outside Use
Utilize the drawio file included in this directory to access all of the diagrams in one place.

To customize a specific diagram, download the svg and in [draw.io](https://draw.io) create a new diagram and load in the svg.

To download the [svg from github](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-identity-config/tree/main/docs/.images/diagrams), select one of the svg files, then select the download button in the top right of the `Preview` view.

Alternatively you can also download the svg from the [uds.defenseunicorns.com](https://uds.defenseunicorns.com) docsite by right clicking and selecting the `Save image as` option.

#### If you have suggestions for the diagrams, we welcome issues or pull requests contributions to [uds-identity-config](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-identity-config).
