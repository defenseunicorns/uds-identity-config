## Cypress Testing
Using uds-cli task [`uds-core-integration-tests`](../../tasks.yaml). 

Task explanation:
  - Generate fresh PKI certs using the `regenerate-test-pki` task
  - Create docker image that uses the new certs as well as a testing realm.json ( has a defined user, no MFA, and no email verification )
  - Clone [`uds-core`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core) necessary for setting up k3d cluster to test against
  - Retrieve the cacert that the docker image is using
  - Use that cacert in deploying `uds-core` [istio gateways](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/tree/main/src/istio/values)
  - Create zarf package that combines uds-core and identity-config
  - Setup k3d cluster by utilizing `uds-core` (istio, keycloak, pepr, zarf)
  - Deploy zarf package that was created earlier
  - Run cypress tests against deployed cluster
